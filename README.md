Hello there, my name is Beryl Chotama Putra. I'm from Indonesia ! Beautiful country isn't it? ;)

I'm on my 3rd year of medical school. 1 years back i got interested in web making. I thought it will be easy as i don't need to know coding. Yes it is indeed easy to make a website, but i find that making website from cms provider such as blogger, wordpress, wix, and so on is very limiting for me, as i have a really big dream ahead. I really want to make a beautiful website that i can be proud of.

So i started my web developing by learing bits by bits of html, css, js, php, and many more. I also might advance my knowledge by learning bootstrap, scss, sass. You can learn along if you want ;)
